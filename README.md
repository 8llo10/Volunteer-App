# Volunteer-App – UP Together
A user-friendly platform that centralizes volunteer opportunities, offering easy registration, search, event management, and notifications to boost community engagement.

A simple project I built while learning GitHub and app development.  
It centralizes volunteer opportunities and includes:

- Easy registration for volunteers and organizations  
- Search and filtering for opportunities  
- Event management tools  
- Notifications and reminders  

This was created as part of my practice and learning journey.
